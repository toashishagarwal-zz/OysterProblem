1) The problem has been solved using a menu driven, command line option. DriverProgram.java is the main application file.
2) First the user needs to load the amount in the card. Keyboard option is --> L
3) Then the user can opt for Taking a trip (Keyboard option - T) or Quiting (Keyboard option - Q)
4) On choosing T, the user is asked about the trip details - source, destination, mode, enter and exit
   Based on these values, the fare is calculated and the amount is deducted from the card
